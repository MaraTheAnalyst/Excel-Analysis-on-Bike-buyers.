# Bike Buyers Analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis project explores bike sales across Europe, the Pacific, and North America to uncover trends and better understand the company’s target audience. The goal is to generate data-driven insights and recommendations for improved decision-making.

### Data Source

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the “customers’ database.xlsx” file, which contains detailed information about each customer who purchased a bike from the company.

### Tool Used

Microsoft Excel - Descriptive Analysis

### Data Cleaning:
 Cleaned and formatted raw data using Excel functions such as Trim and Text.

### Data Analysis:
 Used formulas like  If and pivot tables to segment and analyse the dataset across various categories. 

### Visualization:
 Created clear, insightful charts (e.g., clustered column and pie charts) to visually represent trends in income, commute distance, and age groups across bike purchases.

### Report/Findings:
The following results were obtained:
- Single customers purchase more bikes than married customers, despite lower income and longer commute distances.
- High school graduates are the dominant buyers, more than those pursuing bachelor's or graduate degrees.
- The key age bracket for bike purchases is 31–54 years.
- North America records the highest bike sales, followed by Europe, with the Pacific region showing the least sales.

### Recommendations:
Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:
- Target single professionals aged 31–54 with commute-friendly and affordable bike options.
- Create tailored campaigns for high school-educated buyers, emphasizing practicality and lifestyle.
- Increase marketing efforts in North America and Europe to strengthen and expand market share.
- Investigate low sales in the Pacific region and adapt strategies to better fit that market.

### Limitation
During data cleaning, I removed duplicate entries to ensure accurate results. I also excluded irrelevant columns such as Home Owner, Occupation, and Customer ID, as they had little to no impact on the analysis.
